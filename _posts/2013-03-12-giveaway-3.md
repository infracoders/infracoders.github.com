#description on one long line please
description: An essential part of cryptography is the ability to generate random numbers.  This actually quite hard for computers to do.  Unix-like operating systems try to use the entropy of their environment to help using external input from keyboard, mouse etc.  If you can artificially control the availability of random numbers on a system, this can be a way to hack it.  For example, if you could replace the kernel module for /dev/urandom with one that emits "4".  However,  intel CPUs manufactured recently have a random number generator on die that can be used for seeding. You can pop a number off the stack but not inspect it.   <br>This hack uses <br> 1. jquery to grab the list of attendees <br> 2. wraps some asm in some python <br> 3. abuses the CPU instruction to get a "random" number <br> 4. picks a winner using this number  "Not backdoored at all"
bugs: Zero error checking, RDRAND isn't very entropic
