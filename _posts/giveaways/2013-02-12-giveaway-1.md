description: Use curl to grab some json from the Meetup API.  The json is a list of infracoders members who have visited the site recently.  Pipe it through a few simple commands to narrow it down to one user. <br> curl -s "https://api.meetup.com/2/profiles?key=$MEETUPAPIKEY&amp;group_id=3399832&amp;order=visited&amp;desc=truei&amp;only=name"| jgrep --start results --simple name | sort -u | sort --random-sort | head -n 1 <br> (You can get an API key here http://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/key/ )
bugs: Doesn't take in to account who is actually at the meetup!
