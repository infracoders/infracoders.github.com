#description on one long line please
description: <br>1. Attendees of the meetup sign in to the site with their google credentials. <br> 2. App written in node.js looks up their gravatar <br> 3. Makes a 2 bit version of the avatar <br> 4. Uses this image to seed a game of Conway's life <br> 5. Takes the score from this and makes a leaderboard to pick the winners. <br> Amazing abuse of technology! Congratulations to the Infoexchange dev team :-)
bugs: First two winners were suspiciously the same score.  Suspect a default avatar scores highly for some reason.
