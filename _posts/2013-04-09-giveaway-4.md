#description on one long line please
description:  This giveaway was directly related to the logstash talk.  A simple HTML form was created that submitted to itself with a GET request.  This was to put some data into the apache log file.  Meetup atendees were asked to pick a random number and sumbit it using the form.  Then a random number for the winner was created with bash $RANDOM.  The logstash UI was queried to find the first winning number and name.
bugs: None, it was brilliant.
